# üö¶ AI-Powered Road Accident Prediction System

## üöß Problem Statement

Road accidents remain a leading cause of injury and death worldwide, resulting in significant loss of life and property each year. Traditional methods of accident analysis are often reactive, lacking the ability to provide real-time insights or predictive warnings. These limitations hinder timely interventions and proactive safety measures.

This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to transform how road safety is managed. By analyzing large-scale traffic, weather, and accident datasets, the system identifies patterns and predicts accident-prone zones. The goal is to empower authorities with real-time alerts and actionable insights, ultimately reducing the frequency and severity of road accidents and contributing to smarter, safer transportation systems.

## üéØ Objectives

- Collect and preprocess historical and real-time traffic and accident data.
- Identify key factors contributing to accidents.
- Build predictive models to forecast high-risk areas.
- Provide actionable insights and visualizations via dashboards.
- Support traffic management decisions through real-time alerts.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Scope

- **Data Sources**: Accident records, traffic sensors, weather APIs, GPS data, road maps, crowdsourced reports.
- **AI Models**: Uses ML/DL (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks) for prediction and classification.
- **Real-Time Capabilities**: Integration with APIs, smart city systems, and real-time analytics.
- **Limitations**: Depends on data quality; does not implement physical infrastructure.
